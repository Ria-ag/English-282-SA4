    <h1>How Fast the Sky Moves</h1>
    <div class="post-meta">February 2026 · Reflections</div>

    <p>Last night I lay on the bench between Lander and Maple Hall for an hour and watched the stars move. It started as just a way to relax, but I ended up with a math problem.</p>

    <p>If you stare long enough, the movement becomes undeniable. The sky slides slowly to the side like a massive, patient conveyor belt. I tried to estimate how far and fast it was moving. Then, I scaled it to how fast the Earth rotates. I thought about circumference and angles and did the kind of back-of-the-envelope math you do when you don't have anything but time.</p>

    <p>I ended up close. Not exact, but close enough that it felt real.</p>

    <p>Someone figured this out thousands of years ago without calculators, without satellites, without space agencies. Just observation, geometry, and patience.</p>

    <p>We talk about ancient thinkers as if they were mystical. But they were probably just people lying on the ground, looking up, refusing to stop at “that’s pretty.” They were working with the same sky, the same rotation. The main difference between Aristotle, Eratosthenes, Ptolemy, and us is that they had longer attention spans and fewer notifications.</p>

    <p>What unsettled me was that their conclusions still hold. About 2,300 years later, we're still agreeing with them about basic planetary motion. The Earth still rotates, and it still has a circumference of about 25,000 miles. We might have added detail and refined models, but the foundation is still there.</p>

    <p>And that made me think about legacy.</p>

    <p>We are taught to want it. To create something that lasts. To matter beyond our own lifetime.</p>

    <p>But the longer I lay there, the less romantic that idea felt.</p>

    <p>History is not so kind to people ahead of their time. Socrates was executed. Other radical thinkers were exiled, mocked, or imprisoned before they were validated. The world rarely rewards you in real time for being right too early.</p>

    <p>If your name lasts 2,300 years, there is a decent chance your present moment was uncomfortable. Which is why I think it's strange how we treat longevity as the highest form of success. While it sounds noble from a distance, up close, it often looks like resistance, isolation, or conflict.</p>

    <p>Lying there that night, I wasn't thinking about being remembered. I was thinking about being correct in a small, quiet way that only mattered to me. There was something grounding about independently reaching a conclusion that ancient people already reached. It was meaningful because it showed me human reasoning stretches across time: the same curiosity still works.</p>

    <p>It was a fleeting moment, but it made me feel connected to something larger than myself.</p>

    <p>Not everything meaningful is meant to last forever. Some things only need to be understood once, by specific people, in specific moments.</p>

    <p>The stars will outlast all of us, regardless. The Earth will keep turning whether anyone attaches their name to the calculation or not, and there is something freeing in that.<p>

    <p>The stars kept moving while I was thinking about all this. They did not care who figured it out first. They will still be moving tomorrow.</p>
